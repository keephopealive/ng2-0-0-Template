# The purpose of this Repo is to give you the light wieght version of an Angular 2 Application (without having to create each file and folder from the quick start)
# The light version of Angular 2 is great to learn with because it does not come with all the added tools the CLI offers, and its thus easier to understand how it works internally.
# I recommend you use the Quick Start guide on Angular 2's website, however if you are tired of creating the files and folders everytime  you start a new app, this is a quick way to retrieve it.
#
# To get started:
# 1) Download or Fork this repo.
# 2) In your terminal, navigate to the app's root directory.
# 3) Run in the terminal: 'npm install' This should install all the package.json libraries for Angular 2.
# 4) Run in the terminal: 'npm start' This should start your basic application.
# From here you can start adding Components to your Angular 2 Application.
